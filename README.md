<h1>MeDetect</h1>

The Project aims to estimate whether a patient is suffering from one of the following diseases:

1.Parkinson's Disease (xgBoost)
2.Diabetes (Random Forest Classification)
3.Brain Hemorrhage (CNN)
4.Breast Cancer (ANN)

The Estimation is done on the basis of various ML models uniquely built for each disease.
The ML Models is then incorporated with an interactive Front-End Design which can be used by patients  
as well as doctors to get a second opinion on their treatment. The models have the accuracy of 94%, 80.5% ,90% ,and 95% respectively.

Components Used in MeDetect :-

FRONT-END:
1.HTML
2.CSS
3.BOOTSTRAP
BACK-END:
1.FLASK
MACHINE LEARNING
1.PYTHON LIBRARIES-Pandas,numpy,keras,scikit-learn,matplot-lib
DESIGN

Implementation Status:-
->The ML Models are ready and fully-functioning
->Design Prototype is completed
->The Website is still under development and not fully functional.
