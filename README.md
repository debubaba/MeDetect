<h1>MeDetect</h1>

<p>The Project aims to estimate whether a patient is suffering from one of the following diseases:

1.Parkinson's Disease
2.Diabetes
3.Brain Hemorrhage
4.Breast Cancer</p>

The Estimation is done on the basis of various ML models uniquely built for each disease.
The ML Models is then incorporated with an interactive Front-End Design which can be used by patients  
as well as doctors to get a second opinion on their treatment. The models have the accuracy of 94%, 80.5% ,90% ,and 95% respectively.

Components Used in MeDetect :-

FRONT-END:
1.HTML
2.CSS
3.BOOTSTRAP
BACK-END:
1.FLASK
MACHINE LEARNING

Implementation Status:-
->The ML Models are ready and fully-functioning
->Design Prototype is completed
->The Website is still under development and not fully functional.
